This program is a twitter bot that when run will take your latest mention and use it to search for the most popular post using
those words. This program is set you retweet every hour but that can be changed by changing the wait global variable (which is
in minuts)

This program has 2 seperate threads one that collects the information from your mentions and another that handles the reposting.

You can use this program for your own twitter account by changing where the program saids 'your keys' to the appropriate keys
for your account.
